THE SCENT OF CINNAMON AND OLD BOOKS HUNG HEAVY IN THE AIR AS ELARA TRACED THE 
WORN SPINES OF THE ANCIENT TOMES. DUST MOTES DANCED IN THE SINGLE SHAFT OF 
SUNLIGHT PIERCING THE HIGH, ARCHED WINDOW OF THE FORGOTTEN LIBRARY. OUTSIDE, A 
SUDDEN GUST OF WIND RATTLED THE SHUTTERS, A MOURNFUL SIGH ECHOING THROUGH THE 
SILENT HALLS. SHE FELT A STRANGE PULL, A WHISPER OF FORGOTTEN STORIES BECKONING 
HER DEEPER INTO THE LABYRINTH OF KNOWLEDGE, PROMISING SECRETS AND ADVENTURES 
HIDDEN WITHIN THE YELLOWED PAGES. IT WAS A PLACE WHERE TIME SEEMED TO BEND AND 
BLUR, AND THE PAST FELT STARTLINGLY CLOSE.
SHE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A THING BEFORE.
